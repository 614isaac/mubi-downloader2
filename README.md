## About
- Based on [mubi-downloader](https://github.com/NDDDDDDDDD/mubi-downloader);
- Added search to whatsonmubi from within the terminal, falling back to manually setting the ID if the movie is not found (e.g. the film is not referenced on whatsonmubi);
- Added easily editable variables at the beginning of the script;
- Added checking IP origin to match country expectation from Mubi.
- All available subtitles (SRT) are backed-up as well.
- mergetomkv.py to merge the backed-up files.
- The code we've added to the original might be ðŸ’© as it's been ðŸ¤– assisted.

"Mubi Downloader" is a Python script that allows users to download movies from the Mubi streaming service. It uses the Mubi API to extract the video URL and decryption key, and then decrypts it using shaka-packager.

Mubi is a streaming service that offers a carefully curated selection of movies from around the world. However, the platform restricts users from downloading the movies to their devices. Fortunately, this script bypasses that restriction and allows users to download movies from MUBI for offline viewing.
